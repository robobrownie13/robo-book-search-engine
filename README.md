## Description

MERN is an acronym for an application that utilizes MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js to create a functioning fullstack app. The goal of this project was to also utilize the query language GraphQL to optimize fetching of data between client and server. By using Google's third party API, users can find and bookmark their favorite books that will display on their profile when they log into the application.

## Usage

When a user first enters the application, a book search engine is presented with a menu containing options to search for books as well as options to login or signup, When choosing the Search for Books option without logging in, users can search for books and view search results with titles, authors, descriptions, images, and links to Google Books. Clicking on Login/Signup reveals a modal with options to log in or sign up. After creating an account or logging in, the menu options change to Search for Books, a saved books option, and Logout. Users can save books to their account, view saved books, and remove them. Logging out brings back the initial menu and search interface.

## Installation

The server requires Apollo Server Express, Bcrypt, Express, GraphQL, JSON Webtoken, and mongoose. The client requires Bootstrap, JWT-Decode, and several React packages. Users will also need node to build and run the application from their IDE.

## Contributions

Any suggestions for optimization can be sent to easorj@gmail.com

## Test

Users can run tests of database setup and return using Apollo in the web browser.
